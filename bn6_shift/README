The Shift patch changes many chips that are considered weak or useless by either a buff or completely replacing it.
It is meant to be a change of pace from standard BN6, allowing for more interesting and fun folders, while still leaving some space for classic BN6 builds.

It was made with the use of the Battle Chip Editor program made by GreigaMaster!

Special thanks to LDR100.
